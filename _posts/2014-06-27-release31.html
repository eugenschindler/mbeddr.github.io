title: A new mbeddr Release
---

<p>
We have just published <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases/tag/0.7-EAP">mbeddr 0.7-EAP</a>. This is the first
release of mbeddr that works with (and requires!) <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/">MPS 3.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You may wonder about our version numbers, and whether we're ever going to remove the EAP tag and get to a 1.0. Rest assured,
    we do have such plans. As it looks currently, we'll most likely get to a 1.0 ca. one year from now. This is aligned
    with out development process of the commercial SIEMENS PLM add on to mbeddr. All of this may change of course,
    but this is the plan.
