title: New Tree View in mbeddr and mbeddr.platform
---
<p>
    Tree views are a proven way of showing and navigating structure in IDEs. MPS
    of course has several of them for various purposes. We have now added a nice
    tree view that can be used for various tasks. The screenshot below shows a call
    stack for functions.

<p>
    Selecting a node in the tree automatically selects the corresponding node in the editor.
    In addition, tree nodes can contribute user-defined actions that are shown in the
    context menu. As with visualizations, a node can contribute different categories of tree
    views. All of this can be defined without dealing with any Swing code. The code
    below shows the implementation of the callgraph; the framework is part of the platform
    and can be used for any MPS language.
