title: COME AND WORK WITH US!
---

<p>
    If you are reading this, we don't have to explain to you what mbeddr and MPS is, so we can just get down
    to business: we are growing the team and we are looking for new developers. If you are a great software developer with good communication skills and
    want to work on exciting technology in a creative and fun team, then <a href="mailto:kolb@itemis.de">send an
    Email to Bernd</a>. Being a great developer is all that's really required, but of course the following
    additional skills are very helpful as well:
    <ul>
        <li>Come up with your own ideas to problems and generally be self-motivated</li>
        <li>Explain complex technical issues to colleagues or customers</li>
        <li>Receive, accept and give constructive feedback</li>
        <li>Language Engineering skills with MPS, Xtext or other language workbenches</li>
        <li>Experience with embedded software (even though we also do other projects here, not just mbeddr)</li>
    </ul>
    We're looking forward to meeting you!
