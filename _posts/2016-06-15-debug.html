title: Debugging MPS code in IntelliJ 
---
<p align="justify">
If you were ever wondering how you could debug the generated sources for your MPS languages and solutions 
then the following video may be a good starting point. The video shows how IntelliJ can be set up 
to remotely debug a running MPS, gives pointers on how you can identify parts of your MPS programs in the 
generated code, and walks you through a concrete debugging scenario for intentions.

Note that the video was recorded while setting up the debugging environment on OSX. On Windows, the MPS 
installation has separate files (for 32 bit and 64 bit environments) for specifying extra VM arguments. 
These files can be found under <code>MPS folder / bin / mps.exe.vmoptions</code> and 
<code>MPS folder / bin / mps64.exe.vmoptions</code>. Simply add the extra VM arguments for the 
remote port to these files if you are using a Windows OS.
