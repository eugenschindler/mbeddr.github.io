title: Eclipse Proposal for mbeddr available
---
We may have mentioned this before, but we are in the process of making mbeddr an Eclipse project. We have been working on the proposal for a while, and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/technology.mbeddr/">it is now online at eclipse.org</a>. So if you are interested in using or participating in the development of mbeddr, there will soon be a well-defined governance process. If you are interested in the project, why don't you register as an interested party for the project?
