We are happy to announce the first release candidate of the upcoming mbeddr 1.0 release.

- Graphical [state machines](http://mbeddr.com/2015/03/05/graphicalSM.html)
- Graphical component wiring 
- Signed bit types
- Improved string handling
- Explicit implementation of function prototypes from external module (@implements annotation)
- General generator speedup
- C90 compatible code generator support (limited but sufficient for most compilers)

MPS 3.2.1 is available from [JetBrains](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/MPS/JetBrains+MPS+3.2+Download+Page)
