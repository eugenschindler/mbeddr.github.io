title: Breadcrumbs in the editor
---

<p>
    Breadcrumbs are a way to improve the user's awareness where in a (big) file he is currently editing. It is essentially
    a "horizontal tree" shown at the top of an editor that reflects the hierarchical structure of an editor's contents.
    Niko has made an MPS extension that displays a breadcrumb in an MPS editor. By clicking on a label the user can jump
    to the corresponding level of the containment hierarchy. By clicking on the little triangles one can see the remaining
    nodes in the hierarchy.

<P>
    To use breadcrumbs in an editor, only two simple steps are required. Nodes that form the hierarchy (and should show up
    in the breadcrumb) must implement the interface <i>IBreadcrumb</i>. The root of the editor that should show the
    breadcrumbs must include a <i>breadcrumb</i> editor cell at the top.

    The breadcrumbs are available as part of the mbeddr.platform.
