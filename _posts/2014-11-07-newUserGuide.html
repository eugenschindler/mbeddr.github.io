title: The New User Guide
---

<p>
As <a href="http://mbeddr.com/2014/09/24/planToFIxUserGuide.html">announced
earlier</a>, this week was the User Guide week. The whole team worked on
the user guide, together. As part of this process, we brought the
contents of the user guide in line with the actual system, we've added a
bunch of additional chapters, and we have also migrated it to the mbeddr
documentation language.
</p>

<p>
While the documentation language supports generation to HTML and Latex,
the new primary target platform is the Presentation Mode: this means,
that the User Guide is supposed to be read right inside MPS. The big
advantage of this approach is the very tight integration with the code
in the Tutorial and other samples. In the future, we'll also add the
ability to press F1 in mbeddr code and jump directly to the relevant
locations in the User Guide.

<p>
To access the user guide, you can click on the mbeddr symbol in the tool
bar, or select it from the bottom of the Help menu. For this to work,
the mbeddr Tutorial project must be visible. This means that you either
open the tutorial as a project, or that the project has to be visible to
MPS: in the next release, the Tutorial (with the User Guide) will be
installed as a plugin, and hence will always be available.

If you have feedback (beyond typos; we don't have a spellchecker in MPS
yet), you can send that to our <a href="mailto:mbeddr-discuss@googlegroups.com">mailing list</a>.
Alternatively you can also clone the <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/">repository</a>, fix the
problems, and send us a pull request.
