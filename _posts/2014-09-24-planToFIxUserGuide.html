title: A concrete Plan to Fix the User Guide
---

<p> 
We have long been (made) aware of the fact that the mbeddr user guide is outdated. It was once a really nice
    document, but then mbeddr evolved, and the user guide didn't. And now it is only marginally useful. We have
    since started a project to write the user guide in mbeddr's own documentation language, but we have not worked
    enough on it to bring it to a useful degree of completeness.

<P>
    To solve this issue, we have decided that the whole team will spend <b>the week of November 3</b> working on the user
    guide. In other words, by November 10 the user guide should be back in good shape. So please bare with us until then.
