    This post is a bit funny. Because if you read it, you wouldn't have to read
    it, because you already know what it says. And if you don't read it, you
    probably should. Anyway :-)

    We have new website. It is built on top of Twitter Bootstrap
    (like any modern website, it seems). We have actually copied the
    structure/code from the <a href="http://xtext.org">Xtext</a> website
    (with their permission; Thanks!),
    so it was easy to build even though no one in the team actually knows
    anything about Bootstrap :-)

    The only thing we haven't figured out yet is how to create an RSS
    feed from this News page. We'll work on that. (Anybody got an idea?)
    So we'll keep the blog at the wordpress site going for the time being.

    Let us know what you think about the new site (design and content).
