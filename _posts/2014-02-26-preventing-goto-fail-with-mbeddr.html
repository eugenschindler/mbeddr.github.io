title: How mbeddr prevents goto fail (and similar problems)
---
<p>
    As a consequence of the <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html">Apple goto fail</a>,
    everybody seems to feel the
    need to point out how their particular system would have prevented this
    problem. So I guess we should do this with mbeddr as well.
</p>

<p>
    One can make out several causes for the problem (in addition to the obvious,
    which is that somebody made a mistake). So here are some thoughts relative
    to these causes and mbeddr.
</p>

<p>
    First, there is a mix up between indentation and actual block structure.
    The goto fail code clearly shows, that the developer intended to make the
    gotos part of the if. After all both gotos were indented. In MPS' projectional
    editor, developers have no control over indentation. So the second goto would
    not have been indented, avoiding the visual confusion.
</p>

<p>
    A second reason for the goto fail could be the missing curlies in the body
    of the if statement. Since the if statement executes conditionally the one
    statement that follows the if condition, it is good style to use a block
    statement there (curlies). In mbeddr, the definition of the if statement forces
    the use of a block statement as the body of an if statement. Thus, an if is ALWAYS
    followed by curlies. This really does prevent
    errors like the one that caused goto fail.
</p>


<p>
    Some people argue that the goto statement should not be used in code in
    the first place (even though the C code in the goto fail example is idiomatic
    C). In mbeddr, it is trivial to define a modular language extension that contains a constraint that
    prevents developers from using gotos, if this is so desired.
</p>

<p>
    If no gotos should be used, then some other means of handling errors need to
    be provided. Obviously, in C++, exceptions could have been used; the fail
    part is an exception handler. However, exceptions do incur some runtime
    overhead, they don't work with functions that return an error code, and, of
    course, they are not available in C. However, in mbeddr, one could simple
    develop a language extension for the following syntax:

<p>
    This extension could be translated in the following way:

<p>
    While the implementation uses the same pattern used by the Apple code, the pattern is
    automatically generated, and hence users cannot make mistakes for error
    handling. This is a little bit like exception handling, but it works only
    locally (it doesn't use longjmp) and it works with existing library functions.
    And of course this language could easily be extended to where the error
    handler can get information about the failed call (by passing a step variable
    to the error handler). One could also easily have several error handlers
    that each handle a specific (range of) error code(s).
</p>

<p>
    By the way, you can find this language extension in the mbeddr repository
    now. It took 30 minutes to build :-)
</p>

<p>
    So this is in fact a nice example how, by avoiding unnecessary detail, a
    language extension can improve the robustness and security (in this case!)
    of low level code. It simply prevents users from making mistakes in the
    (unnecessary) details. In addition, the intent of what the users wanted to
    do is much clearer.
</p>

<p>
    There are many things like that in (embedded) software. The goal of mbeddr is
    to make it simple to extend C with "little languages" that prevent these
    problems.
