title: mbeddr debian package
---
Till today mbeddr was always released as a zip file that you had to unpack to your MPS installation. Which is fine on windows but since Linux systems ship with a powerfull package management system out of the the box, we are happy to announce that mbeddr is now also available as a Debian package. You can either download it from the <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases/tag/0.5-EAP1">Github release page</a> or we have setup a <a href="http://logv.ws/b/2013/10/04/jetbrains-mps-debian-package/">repository</a> containing the MPS and mbeddr package.
