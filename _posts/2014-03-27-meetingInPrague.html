title: MPS/mbeddr Meeting in Prague
---
<p>
    This week, most of the mbeddr team (except Dan and Zaur) had been visiting the JetBrains
    office in Prague to meet with the MPS team members located there, and with a few other MPS
    developers who flew in from St. Petersburg.

    We spent about three days briefing each other about upcoming plans, we discussed
    bugs and upcoming features, and just generally got to know each other better.

    Thank you, MPS Team: it was a nice and productive week, in a very nice office :-)
