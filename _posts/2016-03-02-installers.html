title: Installers for Mac OS X and Windows
---

<p>
    We have built installers for Mac OS X (a DMG file) and for Windows (an interactive installer). They come with
    MPS itself as well as all necessary plugins. While we have not
    yet built an "official" release with those, <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases">the nightly builds</a>
    already ship with these installers.
</p>
<p>
Currently there are still a few limitations. For example, the Mac Installer does not ship with dot and gcc/gdb/make, but
    you easily install those via brew. The Windows Installer comes with everything, including an msys environment.
Both do not yet automatically install the tutorial; but that can be downloaded and unzipped easily.
</p>

<P>
    So: not perfect yet, but significant progress.
