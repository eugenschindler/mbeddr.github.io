title: Pasting C text into mbeddr
---

<p>
A weak aspect of mbeddr has always been the interoperability with existing textual C source. We have made many attempts
at parsing C sources and importing them into mbeddr, all with different degrees of success and various different problems.
</p>

<p>
Out latest, and so far most successful attempt is based on <a href="http://ckaestne.github.io/TypeChef/">TypeChef</a> by
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/">Christian KÃ¤stner</a> and friends). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4PN9ggehQk">Check
out this video to get an impression of the current capabilities.</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are still working on importing whole header files (as external modules) and C files. We also have a good handle on
    the preprocessor (defines, macros, ifdefs), because TypeChef deals with them gracefully.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned.
