title: Detailed Dissection of MPS Dependencies available
---

<p>
	We created a wiki page describing <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/wiki/Dependencies-and-Classpath-in-MPS">Dependencies and Classpath in MPS</a> in great detail. If you ever wondered which entries are required into Solution Dependencies or Model Used Languages, this is the place to look at.
</p>
	The wiki page describes all settings influencing scoping, classpath, and using languages. It points out where to find them and the effects of every setting. It also contains a recipe section containing step-by-step instructions on the required settings for various situations.
<p>

<p>
	Please drop a <a href="mailto:mbeddr@itemis.de">mail to mbeddr team</a> if you're missing a recipe or spot an error.
