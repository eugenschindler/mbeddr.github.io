title: A bunch of new Papers
---

We have just published a bunch of new papers on our <a href="../learn.html">Learn</a> page. The first one,
<a href='../files/projectionalEditing-sle2014.pdf'>Towards Usable Projectional Editors</a> discusses
how MPS has improved the usability of the projectional editor
over the last few years. The second one, <a href='../files/dscv-ase2014.pdf'>Automated Domain-Specific C Verification with mbeddr</a>
is the definitive paper on integrating C-level verification tools into mbeddr in a user-friendly
way. Finally, <a href='../files/mbees2014.pdf'>Preliminary Experience of using mbeddr for Developing Embedded Software</a>
discusses our experience so far with using mbeddr to develop real systems.
