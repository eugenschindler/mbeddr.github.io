title: Updates to the Documentation Language
---

<p>
We have updated the mbeddr documentation language (as part of our and Sioux' efforts to improve the user guide!). In particular,
    we have developed a new Presentation Mode that allows users to conveniently read documentation directly in MPS. We have
    also built a cool way of incrementally "building" example code as part of documents without having to duplicate the
    various code snippets. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kMrvreg6n0">video</a> below (clicking on the image takes you to Youtube):
