title: Janosch Jäger's thesis on schedulability analysis

<p>
    Jan-Philipp "Janosch" Jägers has finished his Bachelor Thesis on schedulability analysis with mbeddr:
</p>

<P>
   <i>Multiple tools are necessary to prove the satisfaction of timing constraints a real-time system has. This thesis addresses the integration and implementation of all components required to perform static schedulability analysis in a single IDE. A domain specific language is defined to provide an abstraction for tasks. With this task language a programmer can define and configure the tasks of his system. The entered information is then used for static schedulability analysis. The usage of the mbeddr project as a basis allows a tight integration of the task language with the mbeddr C programming language and the IDE. An external tool is integrated to get the worst-case execution time of the defined tasks. To validate the results of the worst-case execution time analyzer, a dynamic execution time analysis capability is implemented for mbeddr. The features of the schedulability analyzer are demonstrated by an example compiled for the Atmel AVR 8-bit hardware platform.</i>
