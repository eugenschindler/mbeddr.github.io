title: Migration to MPS 3.0
---
Just a quick update from the mbeddr machine room: as you may know, the release of MPS 3.0 is just around the corner. It will have quite a few improvements in usability, one can add multiple editors for the same concept, and there will also be much improved table support. Over the last few weeks we have been on and off migrating mbeddr to MPS 3.0, and we are almost done. We are currently working on updating the build server. Once this is done, we are planning to create a new binary release of mbeddr, and we are also going to update the user guide to reflect the most recent version.
