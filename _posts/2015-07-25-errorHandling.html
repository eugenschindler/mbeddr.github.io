title: A language extension for Error Handling
---

<p>
    Modern Languages use exceptions for error handling. The big plus of exceptions is that
    they provide, if you will, a kind of additional return value that is handled differently
    from the regular return value. In older languages such as C, the return type of a function
    is often used to return an error code, and if actual data should be returned, it has to
    be done through an out parameter. This is awkward. C provides another way, of course, with
    is the <i>errno</i> global variable. A function can set <i>errno</i> and a caller can
    inspect this variable directly after calling a function. But there is no information in a
    function's signature which errors it may raise and the IDE cannot force the programmer
    to write code to handle them. Exceptions (depending on their specific implementation)
    can provide this feature. A big disadvantage of exceptions, however, is that they require
    longjumps "up the stack". These are expensive and hance often not used in embedded software.
</p>

<p>
    Based on these constraints we have designed a compromise feature for error handling into C:
    <ul>
    <li>Error types are declared in way similar to constants</li>
    <li>Functions declare the errors they may raise</li>
    <li>Only those declared errors can actually be raised by the implememtation</li>
    <li>The caller is required to handle the error with a <i>try/catch</i>-like syntax</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    The feature is implemented by transparently adding an out variable to the function, so no
    long jump is required -- but of course the "exceptions" cannot propagate up the stack and
    must be handled locally.
</p>

<p>
    Currently this only works for functions, but we plan on adding this to components and interfaces as well. Note
    that, as usual, this is an independent language extension and can be used optionally. The feature resides
    in the <i>com.mbeddr.core.util</i> language.
