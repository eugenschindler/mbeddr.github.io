title: mbeddr Talk at EclipseCon Europe 2013
---
From Oct. 29 to Oct. 31, the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2013/">European edition of Eclipsecon</a> will take place in Ludwigsburg, Germany. As usual it is packed full of interesting talks on topics around Eclipse -- and others! For example, there is <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2013/simplifying-complex-embedded-development-processes-mbeddr">a talk about mbeddr</a> on Tuesday the 29th in the BÃ¼rgersaal room. In the talk, Stefan (from BMW Car IT) and Markus will talk about how mbeddr was used to simplify the development of AUTOSAR software. Of course, it includes an introduction to mbeddr itself as well. So if you are at Eclipsecon, please join us for the talk!
