title: New mbeddr release: 0.6-EAP3
---
This release uses MPS 3.0.3 and contains a number of refactorings performed early 2014, such as Chunks and the dot expression refactoring. This is also the first release that contains the mbeddr platform, a set of reusable utilities for MPS that are not mbeddr-specific. Unfortunately the user guide is still not yet updated (but will be soon).

This is also likely the last release on the MPS 3.0.x train, since we are now switching the master branch over to the EAP of MPS 3.1.ï»¿
