title: Querylist - Views im MPS
---
<p>
    So far, MPS has only been able to project nodes at the location
    where they resided physically on the model. So, while the rendering
    of nodes could be designed arbitrarily, the structure of the projection
    itself always had to conform to the structure of the underlying AST.
    In other words, real views were not supported.
</p>

<p>
Enter querylist. A querylist is a list whose contents are the result
of an arbitrary query over the model. The elements in the list can
be editable, there are callbacks for what should happen when things
are added or deleted, and it is even possible to define wrapper
editors for the result elements or override the result element's
editor completely.
</p>

<p>
We are using this currently in two places. First, we use it to show
the signature of inherited operation-like constructs. In this case,
the queried elements are rendered in grey, and they are readonly.
The following picture shows this.

<p>
The second location where we currently make use of this feature is
in assessments. So instead of just showing pointers to the result
elements in the assessment result, we can now show the actual element
inline. If the assessment is used to detect errors, then that error
can be fixed directly in the assessment instead of navigating to
the respective program location.

<p>
The querylist is not yet in MPS, but it is available on the mbeddr.platform.
