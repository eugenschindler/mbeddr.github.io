title: HTML Version of the User Guide
---

As you know, the user guide is written and maintained in inside MPS using mbeddr's documentation language, because
this supports close integration with the mbeddr artifacts documented in the user guide. We have since worked on the
HTML export, and the user guide is now <a target="_blank" href="http://mbeddr.com/userguide/UserGuideExport.html">available online as well</a>.

It still has a few shortcomings including the size of some pictures as well as the layout of some of the embedded sources (because of an MPS bug regarding to-text transformation
of collection layouts). On the plus side, you can use the small blue arrows associated with example code to
directly select the corresponding node in MPS (MPS has to be running, and the tutorial project must be opened for this to work).
