title: A Book about mbeddr (almost)
---
<p>
    Over the last few years, Markus had been working on a PhD thesis
    with Eelco Visser at the TU Delft. The thesis, called <i>Generic Tools, Specific Languages</i>
    is about using language workbenches and language engineering to tackle the adaptation of
    (engineering) tools to specific domains. mbeddr is the <i>the</i> example discussed in the
    thesis. So in essence, the thesis is more or less an mbeddr book -- at the very least it
    is the most comprehensive discussion about mbeddr's idea, the implementation and the
    experiences so far. You can <a href="http://voelter.de/defense/">download the PDF version</a> from
    Markus' website (click on the cover). A printed version will be available in the future.
