<p>
We have recently blogged about a new <a href='../files/projectionalEditing-sle2014.pdf'>paper</a> we wrote on MPS editor usability.
We have now supplanted this paper with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvcXD4cFM4s">video</a> that illustrates all
of MPS' efforts to make editing code in the projectional editor as convenient as possible. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvcXD4cFM4s">Check it out,</a>
    especially if you are skeptical about projectional editing.
