    Here is more good news from the usability perspective. We have introduced groups into the intentions menu to
    clean up the typically long and diverse list of intentions:

    The intention declarations get a annotation that specifies the group label they belong to. In the UI the intentions
    are grouped, using the label. In addition to bringing structure to the intentions menu, the labels are also searchable:
    if, in the example above, you type "comps", then only those intentions that belong to components are shown in
    the menu, further reducing clutter.

    This feature is part of the platform.
