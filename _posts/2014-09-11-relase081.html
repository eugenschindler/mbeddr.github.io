title: Bugfix Release 0.8.1
---

<p>
    We have just published <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases/tag/0.8.1-EAP">mbeddr 0.8.1-EAP</a>.
    This is a bugfix release for the 0.8 release. It fixes two major bugs introduced in 0.8.
    The first one prevented users from running and debugging out of mbeddr on Windows. The second is a mistaken error
    message from the type system when using Boolean types. Though this issue is resolved in the most common use
    cases it might still surface in some corner cases when using number literals with physical units. Since the
    physical units are getting a major overhaul in the next mbeddr release we decided to not fix this in the current
    version.
