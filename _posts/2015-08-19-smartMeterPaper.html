title: mbeddr @ OOPSLA - our experience report on Smart Meter is online
---

<p>
    As you know, we (particularly, itemis France and Stephan Eberle) have been working for a few years on implementing
    a real-world smart meter with mbeddr. Together with <a href="http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/">Arie van Deursen</a>
    we spent the last few months writing a detailed case study paper that evaluates this process as well as the resulting
    software. The paper has now been accepted for <a href="http://2015.splashcon.org/track/oopsla2015">OOPSLA 2015</a>. A preprint
    of the paper is now <a href="http://voelter.de/data/pub/mbeddr-cs-oopsla2015-preprint.pdf">available for download.</a>.
