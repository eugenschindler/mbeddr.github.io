title: An overview over the mbeddr.platform
---

<p>
    In this blog we have often talked about the fact that many of the things we build for mbeddr are not really specific
    to C. We have consciously modularized these into a separate thing called the mbeddr.platform. It is available as a
    separate download. And since today, there is also a <a href="/platform.html">separate page<a> for it. As of now it
    provides a brief overview over the most important MPS extensions available in the platform. There are some more
    goodies available in the platform, we'll add those over the next days and weeks. And yes, this is not a comprehensive
    documentation of all these features, it is just an overview: you'll still have to dig around in the mbeddr code
    base to learn from examples. But now at least you know what to look for. <a href="/support.html"> And you can
        always ask for help</a>.
