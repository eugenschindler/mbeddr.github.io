    Bastian Gorholt of <a href="http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/stg/homepage.en.jsp">TU Darmstadt</a> recently finished
    his Master's Thesis on Parallel Programming for Embedded Software with mbeddr:

   <i>Multiprocessing is becoming steadily more important for raising the performance of computers. Par- allel programming is the key to leveraging such increased processing power. However, parallelization impedes the reasoning about side-effects of application code, which may cause data-races and, thus, non- deterministic behavior. Synchronization via locks is one measure to overcome this menace, by serializing conflicting parallel memory accesses. However, it can also impair an application’s run-time significantly. This thesis shows how mbeddr’s first-class language extension support and IDE integration can be used to partially overcome these issues for embedded software. The new language abstraction, ParallelMbeddr, offers convenient-to-use concepts for explicit parallelization. It provides a thread-safe communication approach by using the typesystem to prevent low-level data-races. Furthermore, it uses mbeddr’s com- piler integration to prototypically optimize the generated code in terms of synchronization overhead. The evaluation indicates that these goals are accomplished, although much potential for improvements and enhancements remains.</i>

    The thesis is available <a href="/files/thesisBastianGorholt.pdf">as a PDF</a>, and the code is available
    <a href="https://github.com/aloifolia/ParallelMbeddr/tree/master/implementation">on github</a>. The thesis has
    been supervised by <a href="http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/sebastian_erdweg__/index.en.jsp">Sebastian Erdweg</a>
    and <a href="http://voelter.de">Markus Voelter</a>.
