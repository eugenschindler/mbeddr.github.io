We have just created a new EAP release for mbeddr. You can get it at the <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases">download page</a>. While we have called it an EAP, this is a fairly stable release that runs on the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/index.html">3.0.1 version of JetBrains MPS</a>. We are targetting a final 0.5 release for Eclipsecon next week. The code is probably ok, but we are struggling with updating the user guide in time. Keep the fingers crossed :-)
