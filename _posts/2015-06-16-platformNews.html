title: New Utilities in the Platform
---

<p>
    We have worked on the platform and added additional, reusable MPS utilities:
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://mbeddr.com/platform.html#targetchooser">Targer Chooser:</a> A dialog to choose nodes in a model, typically when trying select a location where to put something in a refactoring or intention</li>
    <li><a href="http://mbeddr.com/platform.html#selectionintentions">Selection Intentions:</a> Intentions that can be used with more than one node at a time</li>
    <li><a href="http://mbeddr.com/platform.html#modellisteners">Model Listeners:</a> A listener that reacts to changes (children added or removed) in a model</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Check them out on the master branch; they will be in the next platform release as well.
