title: New mbeddr Release
---
<p>
    On our <a href="https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core/releases">github release page</a> we have just released a new version of the mbeddr MPS plugins. This is the first release based on MPS 3.0 (see previous post on how to get it).
</p>

<p>
    While we have been working with this state of the code on MPS 3.0 for weeks now and consider it stable, there may still be a few bugs as a consequence of the migration (hence the EAP: Early Access Preview). Also, we have not updated the user guide in a while, so it may not be correct in every detail.
</p>

<p>
    We have scheduled time for working on the user guide later this year, and we are also working on more convenient versions of getting mbeddr. Among them an mbeddr-specific MPS build that contains all mbeddr-relevant plugins (and only those!) as well as a one-click installer (at least for Windows) that also installs all the necessary tools (cygwin, git, verifiers, etc.).
</p>

<p>
    Stay tuned.
