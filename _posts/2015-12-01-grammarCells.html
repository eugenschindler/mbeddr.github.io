<h3>Grammar Cells (com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarCells)</h3>

        <p>
MPS projectional editor affords users a lot of flexibility in terms of
notational flexibility and language composition. This blog is full of
examples of this, so we don't have to provide more examples.

However, this comes at a cost: building editor in MPS that don't just
look nice but that also are nicely usable can be challenging. In
particular, editor developers have to create so-called actions --
wrappers, side transforms, substitutions, delete actions -- that, for
example, allow entering expression tree structures linearly. Enabling
the insertion of parentheses in cross-tree locations, or splitting a
number literal in two is even more challenging. Implementing all of this
correctly can be a challenge, even for practiced users of MPS. More
importantly, it is easy to forget some of those actions, which then
leads to editors that behave inconsistently: good in some cases, and bad
in others. Such inconsistencies are a major source of frustration for
new MPS users.

To address this issue, we (mostly Sascha) have built the grammar cells
infrastructure. These are new editor cells that have enough semantic
richness so that the necessary actions can be generated automatically.
To implement a nicely usable expression language, developers do not have
to write a single line of action code. Check out this video:

Even though language developers have to invest a little bit of effort
into learning how to use these new cells, it is certainly simpler to
work with than the actions. In particular, it is easier to get things
consistent. Check them out, they are in the master branch.
