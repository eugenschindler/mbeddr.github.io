title: Usability Improvements in MPS 3.1
---

<p>
MPS 3.1 will come with a number of enhancements in the editor usability. I will support setting parenthesis at
    arbitrary locations in expressions, as well as automatic rebinding of broken references. In addition, it is possible
    to clean up the contents of the project explorer by only showing root nodes. Check out the video below (click on the
    image, it open in Youtube).
