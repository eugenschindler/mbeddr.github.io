title: MPS Notations - an overview
---

        We have just added a <a href='files/gemoc2014-MPSNotations.pdf'>new paper</a> to the <a href="/learn.html">Learn</a> page
In this paper we provide an overview over the notations
supported by JetBrains MPS, including text, prose, math tables and graphics.
The various supported notations are illustrated with examples from real-world systems,
most of them are taken from mbeddr. The paper includes graphical notations, about which you'll hear much more soon.
