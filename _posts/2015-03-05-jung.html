title: Graph Visualizations in mbeddr/MPS
---

<p>
Wow, long time no blog. Sorry for that. Here's some news:
</p>

<p>
As an additional means of displaying relationships between nodes (next
to PlantUML and the tree views) we have integrated the <a
 href="http://jung.sourceforge.net/">JUNG framework</a> for graph
display. As a language developer, you can implement an interface
<i>IJGraphProvider</i> and implement a method that creates the graph:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Programmable with high-level API
    <li>Specify initial layout
    <li>Configurable node size, color, line style and color, fill color, shape and label
    <li>Configurable edge width, style, color and label
    <li>Configurable tooltip text for nodes and edges
    <li>Extensibility to plug in your own layouters (such as the one from yWorks)
</ul>

<p>
Once you have created a graph, your users have many options to view the
graph in an MPS tool window:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Double-click selects node or edge in editor
    <li>Zoom and Pan
    <li>Tooltips
    <li>Selectable Layouts
    <li>Selection and highlighting of outgoing and incoming nodes and edges
    <li>Filtering based on node and edge type
    <li>Filtering along a continuous axis (for example, time)
    <li>Incremental, node-based collapsing and expansion
</ul>

<p>
The JUNG integration is available as part of mbeddr, but also as part
of the mbeddr.platform, so you can use it for your own languages. Check out
the <i>Chunk</i> node for an example of how to use it.
